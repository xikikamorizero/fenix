    "aboutUs.text.1": "Project Fenix has been in existence for quite some time, with over two dozen Music and Poetry Evenings and shows, hundreds of people whose souls it managed to touch, more than 30 different performers, and a vast number of stories and emotions. Fenix is a bird of rebirth, it burns and rises from the ashes. Previously, Fenix was positioned as a Creative Collective, relatively closed to outsiders, but it began to burn gradually, which meant it was time to be reborn.",
    "aboutUs.text.2": "We did what we were supposed to do a long time ago: we changed our positioning, we are no longer a closed Creative Collective, now it's a Project, a Creative Flow, a Brand, call it whatever you like, what matters is that now everyone can perform at Fenix events, after going through a preliminary audition, writing to us, and sending their recording. Fenix is not just about poetry and music; it's about the atmosphere, and that's very important. I hope you will feel it too and find a piece of yourself here.",
